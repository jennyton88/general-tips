## Tips

- Create collisions out of meshes
  - Look at the top menu bar just above the editor after selecting the mesh, the button's there
- When the player sort of stuck along the collisions / Creating trimesh (concave) collisions out of meshes
  - Check normals before exporting from Blender, recalculate them before export
  - Temp. fix is use backface collisions for collisions on both sides

## Behaviors

- Static bodies don't interact with area signals on body entered

## Assets

- Web build of Godot doesn't like PNG files, just png, rename and they're fine
