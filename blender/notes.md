# Keyboard shortcuts

## Main

**Note:** press x, y, or z to grab / extrude / rotate on a specific axis

- `g`: grab any part of the mesh to move around
- `e`: extrude a new part of the mesh from your starting point, can also type numbers to specify length of extrusion
- `r`: rotate mesh, can type in angle for exact measurements
- `f`: create new edges between vertexes, faces between edges 


## Others

- `shift + a`: add object to the scene, new mesh like cubes
- `shift + z`: change from wireframe and solid mode
- `m`: merge mesh together at certain points (with context menu), like first selected to last selected
- `o`: toggle proportional editing mode
- `p`: separate (with context menu) parts of the mesh into separate objects
- `i`: inset faces
- `ctrl + a`: for applying transforms
- `alt / option + click`: to select lined up edges, faces
- `tab`: to switch between modes like object and edit mode


## Tips

- Can't select everything in one go? Is x-ray or wireframe mode enabled?
- Unwrapping several squares onto one texture? Unwrap and Reset
